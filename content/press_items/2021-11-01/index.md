As the discovery of the Higgs boson approaches its 10-year anniversary, physicists are busy building on its legacy. Although it was a tour de force, the experimental confirmation left many mysteries still unsolved. To find a way forward, physicists gathered virtually for a symposium at the 2021 APS April Meeting to discuss the potential for a muon colliderâ€”an ambitious new machine that could help answer many questions.
