Scientists have announced a breakthrough that could be key to the creation of a powerful new kind of particle collider. As reported in the journal Nature, the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment, or MICE, has for the first time demonstrated the successful taming of a beam of particles called muons through a process called transverse ionization cooling.
