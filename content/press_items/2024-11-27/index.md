How do you solve a problem like dark matter? Or explain why the Universe is built the way it is?
For physicists, there’s been one answer that has worked for nearly one hundred years - take two particles and smash them together as hard as you can. But the current generation of massive colliders like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, haven’t produced the flood of new particles some scientists were expecting.
So attention is turning to a new type of experiment, using a particle that has never been collided before; muons.
