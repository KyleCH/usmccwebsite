Recent [progress](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/mice-brings-muon-collider-closer-to-reality) in overcoming technical challenges posed by the muon's lifetime has generated a great deal of excitement for particle physicists. Current focus is on advancing a full design for a 10 TeV collider to prepare to build a demonstrator.
