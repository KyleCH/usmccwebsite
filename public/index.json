The LHC, located near Geneva, Switzerland, is the world’s most powerful particle collider. It accelerates and smashes atomic nuclei together, recreating the energetic conditions that existed after the Big Bang and generating new particles. Huge detectors record the collisions, and scientists study the products.\nWhat are the smallest things that exist? The subatomic world is a complex mosaic of fundamental particles, fields and forces. But there are still many pieces we don’t understand.\nHow can we find these particles? Albert Einstein discovered that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin. Pack enough energy into a tiny region of space, and new particles will pop into existence.\nWhat does this research accomplish? Uncovers the ultimate laws of nature Charts the origins of the universe Explores the properties of matter and energy What’s next? Scientists are characterizing the newly discovered Higgs boson, investigating subatomic interactions and searching for new particles and forces.

A muon collider is the only near-future technology to allow exploration of the 10 TeV scale and beyond.\nExploration of the energy frontier has led to some of the most fundamental discoveries of the last century. To continue this exploration into the future, a paradigm shift is needed. We cannot simply build larger and larger versions of the same ee and pp machines: constraints from cost, available land, and energy efficiency put a cap on the reach of these machines.\nA muon collider is an affordable, compact, and energy efficient solution that provides the potential to explore energies well beyond the 10 TeV scale. But to realize this vision in the future, research and development is needed today.\nWhy now? Recent breakthroughs and the need for a global collider future make now the right time to act.\nOver the last decade, major developments in target technology, high field magnets, ionization cooling and precision timing detectors have turned a muon collider from a far-off dream to a tangible possibility. However, realization of such a collider still requires significant international R\u0026amp;D and demonstrator program stretching over the next 2 decades.\nCurrent estimates for the duration of the required R\u0026amp;D program aim for technical readiness to construct the machine in approximately 20 years, making a muon collider the fastest path to energies beyond the LHC. However adequate funding is necessary to maintain this plan and prevent loss in expertise and personnel. With dedicated R\u0026amp;D today, we can re-invigorate the US accelerator program, and inspire particle physicists for decades to come.\nPiggybacking off of planned upgrades for Fermilab\u0026rsquo;s proton complex, there is an opportunity to build a Fermilab-sited muon collider, bringing the energy frontier back to US soil.\nWhat\u0026#39;s next? Accelerator R\u0026D Recent progress in overcoming technical challenges posed by the muon\u0026rsquo;s lifetime has generated a great deal of excitement for particle physicists. Detector R\u0026D Beam-induced backgrounds create several detector challenge: high occupancies, high rates, and large radiation doses. Physics Studies Combining energy and precision, a muon collider provides unprecedented physics reach. Reconstruction Software Great progress has been made towards identifying signals and reject muon beam-induced background, but there\u0026rsquo;s still much more to do. The IMCC The International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC) is hosted by CERN and securing resources to complete a Muon Collider Design Study before the next European Strategy Report.
