A muon collider is the only near-future technology to allow exploration of the 10 TeV scale and beyond.\nExploration of the energy frontier has led to some of the most fundamental discoveries of the last century. To continue this exploration into the future, a paradigm shift is needed. We cannot simply build larger and larger versions of the same ee and pp machines: constraints from cost, available land, and energy efficiency put a cap on the reach of these machines.\nA muon collider is an affordable, compact, and energy efficient solution that provides the potential to explore energies well beyond the 10 TeV scale. But to realize this vision in the future, research and development is needed today.\nWhy now? Recent breakthroughs and the need for a global collider future make now the right time to act.\nOver the last decade, major developments in target technology, high field magnets, ionization cooling and precision timing detectors have turned a muon collider from a far-off dream to a tangible possibility. However, realization of such a collider still requires significant international R\u0026amp;D and demonstrator program stretching over the next 2 decades.\nCurrent estimates for the duration of the required R\u0026amp;D program aim for technical readiness to construct the machine in approximately 20 years, making a muon collider the fastest path to energies beyond the LHC. However adequate funding is necessary to maintain this plan and prevent loss in expertise and personnel. With dedicated R\u0026amp;D today, we can re-invigorate the US accelerator program, and inspire particle physicists for decades to come.\nPiggybacking off of planned upgrades for Fermilab\u0026rsquo;s proton complex, there is an opportunity to build a Fermilab-sited muon collider, bringing the energy frontier back to US soil.\nWhat\u0026#39;s next? Accelerator R\u0026D Recent progress in overcoming technical challenges posed by the muon\u0026rsquo;s lifetime has generated a great deal of excitement for particle physicists. Detector R\u0026D Beam-induced backgrounds create several detector challenge: high occupancies, high rates, and large radiation doses. Physics Studies Combining energy and precision, a muon collider provides unprecedented physics reach. Reconstruction Software Great progress has been made towards identifying signals and reject muon beam-induced background, but there\u0026rsquo;s still much more to do. The IMCC The International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC) is hosted by CERN and securing resources to complete a Muon Collider Design Study before the next European Strategy Report. How to get involved? The international muon collider community is a rapidly growing group that enthusiastically welcomes new members.\nThe best way to get involved is to navigate to our contact page and reach out to someone involved.\n","date":"10 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"US Muon Collider Collaboration","summary":"Why a muon collider?","title":"US Muon Collider Collaboration","type":"page"},{"content":"A muon collider could be much smaller and cheaper than a functionally equivalent proton collider, advocates say.

It is true that decays of muons in the collider ring will produce large numbers of neutrinos that can travel long distance through the earth and a tiny fraction of them will interact with atoms in dense structures located near the surface, producing in principle detectable radiation. It should be noted that neutrinos are present in abundance in our everyday life. For example, on the surface of the Earth, ten trillion solar and atmospheric neutrinos pass through your hand every second, and some will interact with the atoms that make up your hand. The question therefore must be addressed quantitatively - will a Muon Collider produce enough neutrinos to create a problem? Numerous detailed studies have been conducted to answer this question. Preliminary results indicate that with dedicated mitigation strategies, neutrino induced radiation levels produced by a 10 TeV muon collider ring located 200 meters underground, will be significantly below the US occupational radiation limit for general public.\nMisconception 2: The amount of tungsten needed for the detector shielding nozzles exceeds annual world-wide production rate. Truth: The amount of tungsten for the nozzles is negligible compared to the annual production. The two nozzles together weigh approximately 30 tons (and possibly less with further optimization). This is to be compared with the annual production rates that can be found for example here, which is close to 80,000 tons world-wide.
