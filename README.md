This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme. To edit, clone the github and modify the materials in the `content` directory. You can test it locally by [installing hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and running the command `hugo serve`. This will give you instructions for how to view the site via your browser (typically [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)). 

In most cases you'll want to edit markdown files in the `content/` directory. You can find a short guide to formatting in markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
